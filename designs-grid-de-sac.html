        <h2>Grid-de-sac</h2>
        <p>In this grid-de-sac, Mr. and Mrs. Pixel lived in a modernist one-story bungalow. Each morning, Mr. Pixel dragged the bottom of his square-block down the front steps to his floral-designed automobile. Mrs. Pixel acquired it at a half-price, but Mr. Pixel’s coworkers’ faces blurred and began to fragment every time he stepped outside of the vehicle. Meanwhile, Mrs. Pixel placed her regular pizza delivery order, as the pizza restaurant had granted her a shortcut, where she would simply tap behind her ear three times and her saved delivery would appear. Today, she forgot to wake up Junior Pixel for school. She glided with him outside to the streets. She left him hanging around the sidewalk as she moved towards the napping Creeping Juniper tree, which occasionally lay flat against the road as the cars and pedestrians honked in resentment. She began petting it, asking if it had been dehydrated, well-rested, and nourished. The tree’s branches would make rustling sounds as it responded no. While Mrs. Pixel’s head was turned, Junior decided to mimic the position of the tree.
